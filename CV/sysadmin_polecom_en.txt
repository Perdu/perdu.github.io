Administrating Ensimag's Communication Pole's servers : activity summary

Servers state on the beginning :
- A machine under Debian not kept up-to-date since 6 years (only security updates where made). Repositories weren't even reachable anymore -> updates impossible.
- No automatic backup system configured.
- Most recent backups where 4-year-old.

Work performed :
- Obtaining a new server (donation from Ensimag's Junior Entreprise).
- Complete installation and configuration of this new server.
- Communication with Ensimag's computer support team and administration for moving servers to Ensimag's servers room.
- Moving servers to Ensimag's servers room.
- Putting new server into service.
- Communication with the different websites' webmasters concerning the migration, and other.
- Communication with Ensimag's computer support team for the migration of the domain names to the new server.
- Function test of datas' migration and of changing server concerned by the domain names.
- Configuration of an automatic backup and exportation to old server system, the latter being now used as a backup server.
- Rewriting of servers' documentation.
- Setting a minimal quality of service in order to be able to access the server in case of problems (network congestion, high CPU usage).
The whole migration has been done in a way that allowed hosted websites always to be reachable. They have never be unreachable more than 24 hours.

Gained experience :
- Better knowledge in server administration (apache2, mysql, backups handling, misc. configurations).
- Experience in communication with webmasters and technical administration.
- Satisfaction of putting into operation a safer system!
